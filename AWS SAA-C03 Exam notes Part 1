•	S3 standard IA – infrequent access – one – zone 
•	S3 glacier instant retrieval 
•	S3 glacier flexible retrieval 
•	S3 glacier Deep archive

S3 requester pay
Requester or the downloading user must pay for the network cost. 
Use case: Sharing large dataset to another account. 

S3 event notification 
Triggering an event when you do api related activity in S3 
1.	SNS
2.	SQS
3.	Lambda 
Using the AWS services resource access policy 

S3 baseline performance 
3500 request (put/get/delete) per second per prefix in a bucket. 
For performance use the s3 multi part upload and S3 transfer acceleration option to optimum S3 performance usage. 

S3 byte-Range fetches 
•	Can specify and download only the small portion of the large dataset.
•	Can mention specific bytes of the header of the file to download. 
S3 select and glacier select 
•	Filter using the sql query and get the data from s3 
•	Less network transfer/less cost/less CPU 

S3 Batch operation 
Use S3 Batch operation to perform bulk operation on s3 objects 
Use case: encrypt un-encrypted objects
Note: S3 inventory to list s3 object 
S3 inventory -> S3 select -> S3 batch 


AWS Networking basic  
IP is designed with Octets (a group of eight digits) numeric values example: 0.0.0.0
The 1st  four and last IP of the CIDR block cannot be used for any resources. 
They are 
1.	10.0.0.0 – Network address 
2.	10.0.0.1 – VPC router 
3.	10.0.0.2 – DNS server 
4.	10.0.0.3 – Future use 
5.	10.0.0.255 – Network broadcaster address 

CNAME : A record to point to a non-root domain
Eg . myaws.cert.com -> myapp.cert.com  
ALIAS : A record to point to any / domain including root domain but it cannot to be pointed to EC2 instance. 
Eg . myaws.cert.com ->www.cert.com
RDS Proxy 
It is a RDS feature used to make DB more resilient to failover by sharing connection using connection pools. 

EC2  instance store : it is type of data storage provided by AWS 
•	High performance hard disk
•	Better I/O 
•	Risk of data loss  
Disaster Recovery 
•	RPO – Recovery Point Objective 
•	RTO – Recovery Time Objective 

RPO <------(Data loss)----------->Disaster<-----(Downtime)------> RTO

Strategies 
1.	Backup and restore : high RPO/High RTO & low cost 
2.	Pilot light : Core/small version of the application running  where the RPO and RTO is low
3.	Warm standby : full application running in smaller capacity and can be scaled into fully functioning application in few minutes. 
4.	Multi-site : lowest recovery time and a full production ready system running in the cloud. 
 
Database Migration System 
It is AWS migration service and typically used by installing the DMS into EC2 instance and start the migration. 
Source DB (eg. On-prem MS SQL server) -------> DMS (ec2)---------> Target DB (MS RDS server ) 
SCT: Scheme conversion tool used when there are different DB engines involved in the migration where the SCT is installed in the On-prem servers.  
Source DB (eg. On-prem Oracle server) -------> DMS (ec2)---------> Target DB (MS RDS server ) 

RDS / Aurora Mysql/PostgresSQL migration 
RDS -------> Aurora Mysql 
1.	Take a snapshot of the RDS  Mysql Aurora Mysql 
2.	Create Aurora read replica from the RDS and when the replication is zero lag promote to its own DB and it takes time and high cost. 

External MySql to Aurora Mysql 
1.	Use precoma to get the backup and update it to the S3 and the from there upload it to Mysql Aurora. 
2.	Use Mysqldump utility. 

Exam tip : 
EC2 in ALB can check IP of the the client / Application by X-forwarded-for header in the request or X-forward-Port/X-forward-Proto for part. 

S3 Security 
1. S3 bucket policy for/to provide cross account user access

2. S3 static website.
bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com
or 
bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com

S3 replication notes
	•	﻿﻿Only new object replicated after enabling 
  • for existing objects replication use s3 batch repliation
	•	﻿﻿No replication for delete operation with Version ID

Amazon S3 encryption - 4 types
Sevar Side encryption - SSE - S3
  • Keys managed by AWS (we cannot view the key)
	•	﻿﻿encryption type: AES- 256
	•	﻿﻿enabled by default
	•	﻿﻿Must Set header "X-am2-server-side-encryption" : "AES-256"
Insert image here 

SSE - KMS
* key managed by AWS - KMS (user control + can be audited by cloudtrail
* header "X-am2-server-side-encryption" : "aws:kms"
* KMS have limition : API Call 5500 - 30000 (throttling)per second.
* can request to increase the throttling quotas. 

insert image here  

SSE - C
* Key managed by customer outside AWS and encryption done by AWS
	•	﻿﻿key not Stored in AWS.
	•	﻿﻿https only
* used https in all request

Client Side encryption
• encryption done outside by client and Stored in S3 Amazon

Amazon s3 in transit (SSL/TLS) always in https

Amason S3 - force encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) using aws:secureTransport
aws:secureTransport: false (only allows https)


SSE - S3 encryption is applied by default to new objects.

CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Sharing resource from different region 
e.g., for a S3 static website.

S3 Access Log : Use S3 bucket as logging
S3bucket for logs related to S3 access log.

• Never enable monitor to logging bucket resulting in a loop.
• Should be in the same region.

Amazon S3 - Pre-Signed URL
Allowing users to upload/download via a URL with a limited time frame.

S3 Glacier Vault lock & S3 Object lock
WORM - Write Once Read Many
S3 Glacier Vault lock
• Put object in Glacier Vault lock.
• Get vault lock policy.
• Used for compliance.

S3 Object lock - lock the object.
• Retention mode - governance = can overwrite by user.
• Rentention mode Compliance = can't overwrite.

Retention period: extend the fixed period 
legal hold: use IAM permission S3: Put Object Legal Hold to protect the object indefinitely, from independent retention period.

S3 Access Point
• Simply access for S3 bucket. 
• Access point has its own DNS name.

S3 Object Lambda: use lambda function to update or get data and provide that data to many applications via S3 object lambda access point.

AWS KMS
• cloudtrail is enabled for KMS
• Key rotation can be manually done.

Types of KMS key
• AWS Owned keys : SSE - S3
• AWS Managed Keys : aws/rds
• Customer-managed keys

Automatic Key rotation 
• AWS Managed keys: automatic every year. 
• Customer-managed KMS: (must enable) automatic every year. 
• Imported KMS key only manual rotation using alias.

AMS key policy : who can access the KMS and used for cross-account access.

Multi-Region key 
(MRK) is achieved through replication of keys between regions.
Use case: dynamodb global data & Global Aurora. 
fields can be encrypted and decrypted through across region using MRK.

S3 replication encryption
SSE - C objects are not replicated 

S3 - KMS encryption
KMS key policy
May need service annotations increase.
Need IAM Role with (KMS: Decrypt/ KMS: Encrypt).

Sharing Encrypted AMI → KMS
• Source AMI encrypted via KMS.
• Must modify launch permission.
• Target account must have permission (IAM) Role to use then you launch EC2 from AMI optionally can create new KMS key.

SSM Parameter Store
• Store config and secrets.
• Store in hierarchy.

AWS Secrets Manager
• Can rotate secret every X days.
• Integrate RDS (mostly for RDS).
• Multi-Region Secret (for Secret replication).

WAF

• ALB, API, CloudFront, AppSync GraphQL API, Cognito User Pool

WAF (ACL) Rules - (Layer 7 protection): 
• Can allow up to 10,000 IP addresses 
• can filter based on HTTP headers, Body, or URI string.
• SQL injection and cross-site scripting. 
• Block counting (geography master). 
• Rate-based rules (count occurrences per lP) For DDoS protection.

AWS Shield
Use to protect against DDoS attacks: protect from layer 4/3 attacks. 

AWS Shield Advanced.
• 24/7 access to DDoS response team.
• Protect against higher fees during DDoS attacks.

AWS Firewall Manager
• Manages rules in all accounts of an AWS organization.
• Rules are security policy, WAF rules, SG for ec2, Amazon s3 resolver.

AWS guardDuty 
Discovers threads across AWS accounts, gets data from the below 
• cloudtrail logs 
• VPC logs 
• DNS logs 

AWS Inspector
Does security assessment on EC2, Lambda, container images.
• Send assessment to Security Hub for reports and EventBridge for notification.
• Scan infra when needed.
• Provide a risk score.

AWS Macie
Scan sensitive data. Sensitive data stored in S3.

Bastion host
• Public users use bastion host to access private EC2 instances.
• Bastion host should be in a public subnet.
• Internet access must be enabled (SSH 22) inbound, for the bastion host.
• Security group of bastion host must allow SSH to bastion host.

NAT Instance
• Allow instances in private subnet to access internet.
• Must be in a Public Subnet.
• Must have elastic IP.
• Source and destination check should be disabled.
• Route Table should be updated to channel traffic from private subnet to NAT instance.

NAT Gateway
•AWS managed NAT.
• High bandwidth.
• High availability, single AZ.

NACL and Security Group
• NACLs are stateless - (must open ephemeral ports).
• Security groups are stateful.
• Allow, do not edit Default NACL, create custom NACL.
• Security groups operate at EC2 level / NACL operates at subnet level.

VPC Endpoints using PrivateLink
• Interface endpoint - using ENI.
• Gateway endpoint - only used as a target in route table.
• Gateway is free only for S3 and DynamoDB. 
• Use interface endpoint only for S3 and DynamoDB with access required from on-prem or different VPC.

AWS Site-2-site VPN
Service used to connect VPC to on-prem over the internet via VPN, encrypted connection.

Custom Gateway: deployed at client end 
VPN Gateway: deployed at AWS end.
Customer Gateway : use public IP or NAT device to connect to VPN.
VPN at AWS needs to enable route propagation to access on-premises.

VPN Cloudhub
• Connect multiple site VPNs (S2S VPN) - low-cost hub and spoke model.

Direct Connect (DX)
• Provides private connection between VPC and on-premises using private virtual interface (VIF).
• Data is not encrypted and you can add VPN on top of this connection.
• Can connect to public AWS resources.
• Direct Connect gateway can connect to more than one VPC.
• Speed tiers: 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps.
• High resiliency - use two AWS DX connections.
• Maximum resiliency - use two separate connections in single DX location and build two DX connections between AWS and on-prem.

Transit Gateway
• Combine multiple VPNs, AWS VPNs together using transit gateway. 
• Supports multicasting (is only supported by transit gateway).
• Transit gateway + S2S VPN used to create large bandwidth
• ECMP : equal-cost-Multi-path routing
example : VPN to Virtual private gateway
1 = 1.25 gbps 
VPN to transit gateway 
1 = 2.50 gbps 

AWS VPC - Traffic mirroring
Mirror the VPC traffic to AWS resource for inspection or analysis.

Note:
• One cannot disable IPv4.
• In case you cannot launch an instance, a possible issue is that there is no IPv4 available; therefore, create a new IPv4 CIDR in the Subnet.

Egress Only Internet Gateway
Used by EC2 instance in private subnet with IPV6 IP to access the internet only.

NAT gateway IPv4 Only 


Networking Cost in AWS
• If you need high-speed, use Private IP.
• Use some AZs for maximum savings and less networking.

Egress traffic - Traffic going outside AWS network is charged.
Ingress traffic - Traffic incoming from outside to AWS is free.
Egress traffic - Cost is higher.

S3 networking cost 
Use S3 and clodufront is much cheaper option 

Network firewall 
Is implemented at VPC level: Can do traffic filtering - allow, drop, and alert for traffic that filters rules.
Active packet inspection throughout network.
